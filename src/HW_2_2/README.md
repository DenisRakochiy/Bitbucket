 It is necessary to implement a collection that has a fixed size.
 
 The size is set: 
 The default is 16
 As directed by the user.
 The size of the collection after initialization can not be changed.
 
 Each new element is added to the end of the collection.
 After the number of elements has reached the maximum -
 when you add a new item, the collection "moves" to the left.
 
 The 1st element is deleted, and the next one is moved one element
 to the left.
